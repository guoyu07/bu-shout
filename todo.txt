TODO File for the BU Student Union Shout Box
============================================

- Split the Google Analytics footer info into its own template
- Number of comments in brackets next to the title on the main shout page
- Realtime character count (a la Twitter)
- Implement deleted comments and shouts as a BOOL flag that can be undone (a la Gmail), rather than a hard delete
