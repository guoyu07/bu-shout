TODO File for the BU Student Union Shout Box
============================================

- Realtime character count (a la Twitter)
- Implement deleted comments and shouts as a BOOL flag that can be undone (a la Gmail), rather than a hard delete
- GPLv2 and CC the graphics
- Advertise licenses and the Github link
- Mirror (partially?) the main Union navbar
-- Dropdown for student resources? Autocomplete for search (a la Ubiquity)
- Stickies
- WebLogin authenticated posts (but anonymous by default)
